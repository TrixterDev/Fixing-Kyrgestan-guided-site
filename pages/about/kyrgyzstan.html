								Kyrgyzstan is a rugged Central Asian country along the Silk Road, the ancient trade
								route between China and the Mediterranean. The Tien Shan Mountains, which surround the
								old caravan route and dominate the country, are home to snow leopards, lynx and sheep.
								In the south, the millennia-old city of Osh has a huge, busy bazaar that was once a stop
								on the Silk Road.</p>
							<br>
							<p>"Kyrgyz" is believed to have been derived from the Turkic word for "forty", in reference
								to the forty clans of Manas, a legendary hero who united forty regional clans against
								the Enimes, Kyrgyzstan means – The land of Forty Tribes </p>
							<br>
							<p>The 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan is a reference to those same forty tribes and
								the graphical element in the sun's center depicts the wooden crown, called tunduk, of
								a yurt – a portable dwelling traditionally used by nomads in the steppes of Central
								Asia.

							<strong>Location</strong>
							<p>
								Kyrgyzstan lies at the very heart of Central Asia surrounded by the mighty expanses of
								China, Kazakhstan Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. It covers an area of 198,500 sq. km. and
								its longest borders run 925 km from west to east and 454 km from north to south. The
								topography and geography of the country lends itself to a North-South divide, with the
								main concentrations of population/business in the north and south, with an almost
								uninhabited interior. </p>

							<strong>Climate</strong>
							<p>
								The mountainous terrain, distance from the sea and desert outskirts give Kyrgyzstan what
								can only be described as a harsh continental climate, with a big changes in temperature
								occuring over short periods of time. The wettest place is the west slope of the Ferghana
								Range with 1,000 mm, whilst the driest is Balykchy on the western tip of Issyk-Kul Lake
								with 100 mm of precipitation. The average temperature throughout the country in January
								varies between - 4°C to - 14°C and in July between + 12°C and + 40°C and there is an
								average of 247 days of sunshine a year.

							<strong>Landscapes</strong>
							<p>
								The fact that 94% of Kyrgyzstan is covered by mountains produces great variations in the
								geographical, topographical appearance of the country. The lowest valley floor is itself
								500 metres above sea level and the highest peaks soar to more than 7,000 metres above
								sea level in the mighty Tien Shan Range. These mighty peaks are world renowned and are
								part of the exclusive list of 7,000 metre plus peaks of the world - Pobeda Peak (Victory
								Peak) 7,439m, Lenin Peak 7,134m and the legendary Khan-Tengry (7010m) - the white/pink
								marble pyramid held sacred by Kyrgyz through the ages.

							</p>
							<br>
							<p>Mountain lakes abound and arguably one of the most beautiful series of lakes anywhere in
								the world can be found at Sary Chelek in a national park. To see this is to behold the

							<strong>Flora and fauna</strong>
							<p>
								The flora and fauna here are both unique and plentiful, ranging from exquisite
								semi-tropical tulips to stunningly beautiful alpine edelweiss - yes, Kyrgyzstan isn't
								known as the "Switzerland of Asia" for nothing, and the vitamin content of herbs here
								isn't bettered by a single country in the world, not even Georgia, whose herbs are much
								loved by Western medical and perfume companies. There is even a uniquely fir tree - the
								Tien Shan Spruce.

							</p>
							<br>
							<p>The number and range of birds of prey has to be seen to be believed and travellers to the
								more remote parts of the country will be amazed at how close they can get to these
								animals if they are careful. Although they should probably be counted as domestic
								animals, it should be noted that camels and yaks are also to be found in the higher
								areas and plans are afoot to dramatically increase the breeding of yaks.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>To do full justice to the wonderful range of flora and fauna would take far more space
								than is available here - so, again, please come and see for yourself - you will not be
								disappointed! </p>

							<strong>Economy</strong>
							<p>
								Since the collapse of the Soviet Union the economy has undergone massive changes and is
								still evolving. The Centralized Command Economy has been totally replaced by a free
								market economy. This has entailed several distinct phases, which have all had their
								pluses and minuses. Agriculture was and still is the largest employer of people in the
								Kyrgyz economy. Land reforms in Kyrgyzstan have progressed further and faster than
								anywhere else in the CIS and the result has been a bit of a mixed bag. Kyrgyz citizens
								meeting certain clearly defined criteria have received land shares (plots of land) as
								private property. Since the collective farms were broken up and people formed their own
								flocks, a great number of the national flock of sheep have been killed but now numbers
								are increasing again as the value of the flock as a source of income is becoming more
								and more apparent. This also applies to other farm animals such as horses.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								There are natural resources, in particular water and that has led to the development of
								the hydro electricity industry. Several substantial plants are due to be completed in
								the next few years. Electricity exports continue to grow every year and are really only
								restricted by the limited load capacity of the HT lines from the country. However,
								unlike the other Central Asian states, Kyrgyzstan does not have large reserves of oil
								and gas. There are large coal reserves but at present access is very difficult and
								transport costs make them impossible to market. However, when the projected China - Iran
								- Europe Railroad is built these resources should become much more exploitable. Gold is
								one resource much in demand and there are currently 130 plus mining companies active in
								the country. A major resource, uranium, is no longer in such great demand on the world
								market.

							<strong>Nomadic tradition</strong>
							<p>
								The Kyrgyz people are a mix of the clans who migrated from the banks of the Siberian
								Yenisei River, with Mongols and smaller tribes whom they absorbed over the centuries.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The Kyrgyz people are real nomadic people with a strong nomadic tradition and prefer to
								live in the mountains, in contrary to the Kazakh people, they prefer to live in the
								steppes (also in a yurt).
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								For centuries the nomadic people lived in portable dwellings, yurts. The yurts are very
								suitable for transportation and it is not difficult to assemble them. They are also good
								for living because they are warm in the cold weather and cool in the summer. The Kyrgyz
								put felt rugs ("koshma") on the ground of yurts and decorate walls with felt shyrdaks
								(carpets). The rich people make their yurts beautiful with brightly colored shyrdaks and
								use richly embroidered woven strips. The left hand side of the yurt is for men and
								contains horse or hunting gear, and the right hand side with the stove and cooking
								utensils is for women and the most honoured place in the yurt is opposite of the
								entrance, 'for the guests'.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Traditional clothing of Kyrgyz men consists of a padded or sheepskin coat, boots, and a
								white felt hat with black or red flaps ("kolpak"). Married women also put on often a
								white turban made of a long scarf. Marriage for the Kyrgyz people was always very
								important. Earlier and also very often now in the villages an arrangement is usually
								made between parents. Poor men had to wait for years to save enough before being able to
								marry. The young woman's dowry to her new family included the yurta, household
								equipment, etc. All of it could then have her children (polygamy was common). A woman
								could divorce her husband and, if he died, she had the right to remain single. When her
								husband was not at home and after his death, she was the chief at home.

							<strong>Agriculture</strong>
							<p>
								It is important to mention that in Kyrgyzstan they export wool, meat and cotton. Farming
								and livestock raising are about one-third of the country's production, the most part of
								workers are employed in this sphere. Sheep, yak and horse breeding for wool, meat, milk
								and fat are the basic occupation of the Kyrgyz. The sheep is also used for the wool to
								make felt. The Kyrgyz like to make clothes, yurts and rugs using felt. Since
								privatization the livestock herds diminished from 8.7 million in 1992 until 3.8 million
								in 1998, mostly sheep and goats.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Farming is not everywhere possible, only on 60 % of the land. Most of the land is
								suitable for hayfields and pastures, total 7% of the land is arable, and the major crops
								are grains, fruit, vegetables, cotton and tobacco.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								In the north of the country there are mostly small farm enterprises (mainly livestock
								raising) and in the south, where a big percentage of the Uzbek people live, they are
								involved into growing of cotton, tobacco, grains, rice etc.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								After independence many of the state farms became agricultural enterprises and some
								cooperatives or individuals also became owners of the land. But because of less of
								experience many sold off their property again. Also the machinery that was in work in
								the Soviet period was partly sold by farm managers or hired out to some small farmers.
								Although there are many economical obstacles and problems in the country agricultural
								production is growing at the present time.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								The real treasure of Kyrgyzstan is the world's largest natural walnut forest in the
								south of the country around Arslanbob. About 600 thousand hectares of walnut groves.

							<strong>Kyrgyz cuisine</strong>
							<p>
								Meals of the Kyrgyz often begin and end with prayer. Meals are served on the cloth set
								on the floor or a very low table. It is necessary to offer or receive food with the left
								hand. You always should eat a little bit of bread if you are in the house of the Kyrgyz
								people even if you eat it not much. Tea is also always on the table in the Kyrgyz house.
								If you eat in the yurt you can see that the guests sit only around the mat opposite the
								door where it is very warm. All other people sit in order of age or seniority and the
								host sits with his back to the entrance with his wife on his right side to serve the
								food.

							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Sheep is the basic food for the Kyrgyz, most popular dish from sheep is 'beshbarmak'
								which they eat with their hands. The head of the sheep will be given to the most
								honoured guest or old people. The eye of sheep is always given to guests or to new
								friends.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Dairy products, like buttermilk, ayran (a yoghurt drink), cheese and fermented mare's
								milk 'kymyz' is the second main group of products on the eating table of the Kyrgyz.
								'Kymyz', fermented mare's milk, is said to be a treat. They say that kymyz has curative
								properties and even use it to treat anaemia, tuberculosis, etc.

							<strong>Shamanism</strong>
							<p>
								Shamanism appeared in Kyrgyzstan when the first invades came from the Siberian region.
								The word shaman is from the word saman with the meaning “he who knows”. In nomadic times
								the shaman was the central figure to the life of the tribe, because he organized rituals
								for important life events and solved spiritual and medical problems. The main thing is
								the belief in many spirits and that our souls belong to a spirit world. The shaman is
								both medicine man and a prophet, and escorts the soul of the dead into the next world.
								The spiritual journeys the shaman makes appear in Kyrgyz epics and songs.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Some remnants of shamanist practice are still alive in Kyrgyz life today. Many will say
								that a shaman is a consulting doctor.

							<strong>Folklore</strong>
							<p>
								Central of Kyrgyz culture are the songs, poems and stories performed by local bards
								(akyns).
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Akyns were important persons at weddings, anniversaries and other festivals. They were
								often accompanied by komyz, two-stringed instrument like a lute or guitar. A special
								group of akyns were Manaschi, the narrators of the Manas epic. Some akyns became famous,
								such as Toktogul, Tokolog Moldo and Bokonbaeva.
							</p>
							<br>
							<p>
								Most important modern Kyrgyz author is Chinghiz Aitmatov. He writes in Kyrgyz and also
								in Russian, and many of his titles were translated in English, German, French, Dutch and
								other languages.
